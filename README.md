## Week Challenges:

### Thuesday:

#### **1. Interpreted vs Compiled Programming Languages:** ✅

The interpreted programming languages are those that the interpreters execute line by line, so if you want to make a change simply add it and the interpreter transmits it as it happens.

While compiled programming languages are converted directly into machine language, they also require an additional step which is the compilation, in this case, when making a change in the code, the program must be executed again from the beginning to be carried out. For this reason they tend to be faster than the interpreted ones but this is changing with the passage of time.

#### **2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?** ✅

java is a hybrid language since it is interpreted and compiled at the same time in the following way:
- With the compiler, the source code is converted into files with the .java extension.
- Then the interpreter executes each one of these instructions in the computer.

#### **3. Pseudocode currency converter** ✅

```
1. START 
2. AMOUNT <-- GET
3. BTC_value <-- GET
4. RESULT <-- AMOUNT * BTC_value
5. PRINT <-- RESULT
6. END
```

#### **Learn about High and Low level languages** ✅
